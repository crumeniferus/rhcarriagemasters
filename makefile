#Makefile to perform software releases.

###
#
# Note that this is in transition from an old scheme that used different directories to reperesent the progression of a project.
# The new scheme is in progress: it makes much more sense to use the branching facilities of Git or different release stages.
# New plan is that there is a "site" folder which contains only the deliverables and not all the macros and text files. 
# For now, the build directory also contains all of those, just because of a lack of mental clarity.
#
###

#Progression is:
#  devel->beta->live
#Each stage must be obtained using checkout from Git.
#The user must know which stage is currently checked out and use the correct input to make, otherwise you end up with the wrong deliverables.
#Ideally, the makefile will determine the current stage for itself. A later development.
#Here are the steps that this makefile will take to get a stage out into the wild.
# Step				Progress
# Checkout
# Call the build makefile	Done
# Copy from build to site	Done
# Upload to server		Done
