# This workflow is represented by a simple category/strategy/queue approach.
# Each step in the process is represented by a queue.
# Each queue is a directory and the files within it represent the cases in that queue.
# Queues are sequential and a case can not be in two queues at once.
# When a case is in a queue, it is still waiting to be serviced.
# When a case has been processed in the queue, it is moved to the next queue.
# This particular process is a series of manual tasks: image editing.
# Moving a worked case to the next queue is a manual process performed when the image editor has finished the edits required in that queue.
# In most file systems, the timestamp of each queue directory will be equal to that of the newest case file.
#
# In addition to the strategy-specific queues are four standard silos: inputs, outputs, done and rejects.
# These are to help move cases from strategy to strategy so that there are some key fixed elements.
# Here is their intended use:
# inputs
#   Ordinarily, one can expect each strategy to move any files from the inputs silo to the first queue immediately.
# outputs
#   Files created by a queue that are not the case file itself. A strategy could result in more than one output file per case. For example, a processed image can result in the XCF file that was used for the actual editing, and the final exported image files, which could be the same image in more than one format.
# done
#   Case files that have run the complete set of queues without incident.
# rejects
#   Case files that failed a test in one of the queues.
#
# Important caveats:
#  Queue directories must be named with a 2-digit number at the beginning. The number indicates order of processing.
#  The image editing tool is GIMP and the undo history is not preserved in the XCF file. If another image editing tool is used, these features must be considered. To workaround GIMP's ephemeral history, each edit is saved as a layer above the previous. This could in fact make re-working edits easier in some cases.
#  If an image has to be, for example, re-cropped, the file is moved to the necessary directory and the operator uses their personal skill and judgement to re-crop while preserving as much as appropriate and possible of the other edits.
#  Case files can not begin with a dot. This is the name format conventionally used for hidden files and is used in this process for files that are part of the mechanism.
#
# End goals of this makefile are:
#  A single to-do list of what has to be done to advance each case to the next queue.
#  A special file in each silo to ensure that even empty ones remain in Git's repository.
#
